# hello-world
My first repository - learning to use GitHub, R and everything else for the first time!

I'm a new Graduate student at the City College of New York, undertaking a Master of Arts in Economics.
I'm learning to use GitHub to complete an Econometrics course, which handles a lot of the work using R.

It's a steep learning curve but a fascinating one, which I'm sure will take me down a long rabbit hole.

This is a line written in RStudio.
